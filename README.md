> Building the Livebook marketplace we all wished existed. #BuildInPublic

## The Dream

Ever tried finding that perfect Livebook notebook for your ML project? Yeah, me too. That's why I'm building Conga - where brilliant minds can share (and earn from) their Livebook notebooks.

## What's Cooking 🚀

- 📚 A marketplace for premium Livebook notebooks
- 💰 Secure notebook trading (powered by TigerBeetle)
- 🤝 Creator revenue sharing
- 🔄 Monthly subscriptions for power users
- ✨ Direct "Open in Livebook" integration

## Tech Stack

- Elixir/Phoenix (because concurrency is beautiful)
- Ash Framework (declarative power!)
- TigerBeetle (for rock-solid transactions)
- LiveView (keeping it real-time)
- Lots of ☕️

## Current Status

- [x] Core architecture
- [x] Basic marketplace flows
- [ ] Payment integration
- [ ] Creator dashboard
- [ ] Public beta
